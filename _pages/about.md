I am an undergraduate Data Science student at Purdue University with a strong passion for Machine Learning, Data Engineering, and building end-to-end intelligent systems. My work and interests lie at the intersection of applied ML, MLOps, and computational modeling, and I'm especially excited about projects that blend theory with real-world impact.

I’ve previously worked with volumetric CNNs for brain tumor detection, contributed to research-oriented data engineering pipelines at FPT in Hanoi, and participated in The Data Mine, where I gained hands-on experience with large-scale data workflows. More recently, I’ve been developing an ML Model Retrainer Trigger System using Airflow, Dockerized databases, and Microsoft Presidio for PII detection—strengthening both my ML and systems skills.

I love exploring how ML models behave, how they break, and how to design pipelines that make them reliable. Outside of technical work, I also enjoy reading psychological and existential literature, especially authors like Hermann Hesse, André Gide, and early 20th-century French authors.
